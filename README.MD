# WSL Dot files for my probably actual setup
![winporn](winporn.png)
## Tested on:
- Windows 10 1803
- Ubuntu 18.04
- i3-gaps/polybar actual for date 19.10.2018
- Vcxsrv actual for date 19.10.2018
- PulseAudio 1.1 for Windows

## Guide

* Install Ubuntu 18.04 in WSL
* Compile i3-gaps, polybar (these projects have own guides on github)
* For terminal use Terminator (I use it since URXVT is really hard to configure with Agnoster ZSH theme)
* Configure properly Vcxsrv on autorun, scripts are in dots, export PULSE_SERVER/DISPLAY variables
* For my terminal arrow theme install Oh-my-zsh with agnoster theme (zsh shell)
* Use PulseAudio from their own site
* To get running cmd consoles hidden run them via runHidden.vbs (thanks stackoverflow)
* To manage wallpapers use Feh in i3 run script

#### More soon, I'm bit sleepy. If I will have more energy I will commit here better guide. Good night.
